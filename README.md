**Project: Spider-Verse Landing Page**

This project is a Spider-Man themed responsive landing page created using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Development Approach:

* The **basic structure and styling (HTML/CSS)** were implemented by following various YouTube tutorials for landing page development.
* Some of the more complex tasks, such as **alignment of text blocks, applying responsive layouts, and writing basic JavaScript for interactivity**, were completed with assistance due to challenges faced during manual implementation.
* The **JavaScript** code handles elements like button behavior and layout interaction where default styling did not work as expected.

### Features & Functionality:

* **Navigation Bar:** A fixed top navigation bar for clear access to sections.
* **Hero Section:** Includes three-line headings ("MARVEL", "Enter the", "SPIDER-VERSE") with multi-font styling and stroke effects.
* **Subtitle Paragraph:** Positioned below headings, summarizing the Spider-Verse concept.
* **Call-to-Action Button:** A visually engaging button with a hologram background image.
* **Icon Bar:** A four-icon section (Web Shooter, Suits, Devices, Verse) placed below the subtitle to represent key categories visually.
* **Responsive Design:** Layout adapts to different screen sizes using Flexbox and media queries, ensuring a mobile-friendly interface.

### Fonts Used:

* The landing page uses special fonts like **Bebas Neue**, **Bangers**, and **Audiowide** to reflect the comic-book and cinematic style of the Spider-Verse theme. These fonts were imported from **Google Fonts** and applied selectively to different text elements.

### Assets:

* **Images** (icons, backgrounds, UI elements) were downloaded from Google and optimized for display.

### Note:

* Use the provided files and images for proper working.
